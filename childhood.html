            <p> Throughout my childhood, Dad had a cine camera recording every outing.</p>
            <p> The excitement of going to the cinema to see the latest Beatles film HELP.</p>
            <p> Visiting an aunt in her brand new high rise flat, embracing the modern era.</p> 
            <p> Enjoying the local outdoor swimming pool</p>
            <p> And most of all recording simple family fun in the garden</p> 
            <p> This included an array of pets, from tortoise to Henry Gbson, the guinea pig. And endless kittens.</p>
            <p> Thes footage would be viewed on a large plastic screen in a cramped living room. Especially by visitors.</p>
            <p> Out would come, the imaginatively sliced, reels of the latest escapades. Everybody loved it. </p>
            <p> Over the years those memories have been treasured. I always knew my beloved Dads legacy still existed. </p>
            <p> Last year, a much anticipated package arrived in the post.</p>
            <p> The art of Cine to DVD technology meant that on my telly I could travel back to my childhood.</p>
            <p> It was just as wonderful as I remember.</p>
