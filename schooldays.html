            <p> Leaving school at sixteen was the best part.</p>  
            <p> I couldn't wait to join the world of work and start earning. </p>
            <p> Besides the occasional slipper, school was pretty good. </p>
            <p> The biggest highlight was in english class, my favourite.</p>
            <p> It was an entry into a 'Let's make a film' competition. </p>
            <p> 5R wrote, filmed and performed in 'Aspirations'. Dreaming of our future. </p>
            <p> Featuring: an athlete, a ballet dancer, a pop star and I was a bride. </p>
            <p> Filming at a local church garnered attention including a newspaper interview</p>
            <p> At the 50 year class reunion, our foray into movie-making was a hot topics.</p>
            <p> Not long after, the original was posted on youtube.</p>
            <p> The film ends with a droning teacher in a a boring maths class.</p>
            <p> Stepping back from time, I knew I always had a portal back to the Class of 1969.</p>

                <p> QUANTUM LEAP arrived on the small screen in 1989. </p>
                <p> It paired a Quantum Physicist with an US Navy Admiral.</p>
                <p> Then threw an egotistical A1 into the mix. </p>
                <p> Each episiode the scientist arrived into the body of a different person. </p>
                <p> After figuring out who he now was and what predicament he was in</p>
                <p> As a team they had to help out and then try and get him back to present time.</p>
                <p> It ended after 5 seasons with a huge cult following.</p>
